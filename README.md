# ChatGemini

## Introduction :-

A Flutter project that enables you to access the Gemini API from a Flutter application. This application already has an API Key embedded within it but a custom one can also be added if required.

In order to use ChatGemini with your own API Key, you need to get an API Key from makersuite.google.com.
Once you have the key, you can paste it in the profile section of the application and start writing prompts from within the application.
